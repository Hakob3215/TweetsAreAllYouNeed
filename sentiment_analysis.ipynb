If you examine the raw data file, you can see that there is a lot of redundant information such as the time of each tweet or usernames. For our sentiment analysis, we simply need the tweets and ground truth labels. To preprocess the data file, simply paste the original CSV file in the root project directory without changing the file name and run the script `preprocess_dataset.py`. This should create a new CSV file called `dataset.csv`. (The reason why we do not include the data files on the GitHub repository is that they are simply too big.)
