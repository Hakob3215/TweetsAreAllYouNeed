If you examine the raw data file, you can see that there is a lot of redundant information such as the time of each tweet or usernames. For our sentiment analysis, we simply need the tweets and ground truth labels. To preprocess the data file, simply paste the original CSV file in the root project directory without changing the file name and run the script `preprocess_dataset.py`. This should create a new CSV file called `dataset.csv`. (The reason why we do not include the data files on the GitHub repository is that they are simply too big.) Then, you're ready to create a dataset and dataloader below.\n",

The newly added classification layer is untrained (as you'll see in the warning that appears when you run the following cell) and so we have to fine-tune on the Sentiment-140 data. We will also import a pre-trained tokenizer, which is necessary to convert inputs from natural language to a numerical representation machine learning models can understand. The tokenizer imported from Hugging Face uses WordPiece tokenization, you can learn more about the algorithm [here](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/en/chapter6/6)."

The final hidden state corresponding to the `[CLS]` token is typically used as the representation of the entire input sequence for classification tasks, so it will be very useful to us later for sentiment analysis. The `[SEP]` token is used to separate different segments of the input sequence. It helps the model distinguish between different parts of the input and process them accordingly. In our case, one `[SEP]` token will typically be added at the end of the tokenized input sequence (tweet). Finally, the `[PAD]` token is used for padding shorter input sequences to a fixed length, so that they can be easily processed in batches without any shape mismatch issues. With BERT, we would typically pad the input sequence to reach a total length of 512 tokens; however, since we're analyzing tweets that are by definition very short, using maximum sequence length of 128 tokens should suffice.\n",
